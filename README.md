## Safety Features

To ensure that generated code does not negatively impact your system or external environment, aiexe requires manual confirmation from the user before executing any commands. This feature enhances security by allowing you to evaluate and approve commands before they are run. Please be cautious and make sure you understand the purpose and implications of any AI-generated code before you use it.
